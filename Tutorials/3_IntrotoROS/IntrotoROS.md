## ROS Installation 
### Installation Instructions
The ROS website has really nice instructions for installing ROS. This might take a while as ROS is a pretty hefty software. 
a) Open up Ubuntu and open up terminal.
b) Follow these instructions:  http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
### Test Installation
To test to see if ROS has been installed, we will be running a basic program. Open 3 separate terminals and run: 
```roscore``` (terminal 1) 
```rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node``` (terminal 2) 
```rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key``` (terminal 3) 

From terminal 3 you should be able to drive a little turtle around. You have just written your first ROS program!  

## Optional Installations 
a) **Tmux**: ROS often involves you to open many terminal windows. This can be annoying to work sometimes so Tmux helps you split your current terminal into many terminal windows.
